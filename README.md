# Overview

With the Cricket World Cup 2024 coming up, it would be great to have a way to track the scores of ongoing matches while I am working on my computer. So why don't I create a cricket score tracker (CrickTrack) myself! The goal of this project is to create an application which has a purposeful use-case for me, while also learning about different concepts and techniques like web-scraping and GUI design.
